I'm just about starting my career so I don't have an instance where I changed the status quo of a company or workspace but personally I quit my full time job at VMware to pursue a career in web development because I loved it and I only joined VMware out of fear, but I realized that it wasnt for me and I quit in just 3 months, which was definitely a big thing for me, going from the safety of a cushy job to the uncertainty of where I am right now looking for my next career opportunity.
